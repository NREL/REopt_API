    These tests just ensure that input cells in Proforma are filled in with the appropriate values.
    Unfortunately, we cannot automatically validate calculated values in the spreadsheet. So, the only way to truely
    validate the Proforma is to visually compare the Proforma LCC's and NPV against the API's results.

    200415 nlaws: removing the tests for input cells vs. database. No reason to maintain these tests now that the
    proforma rows are created dynamically in the proforma_generator. As mentioned above, the only way to test the
    proforma is visually comparing the NPV, LCC's, etc. between the API response and the Excel workbook.
