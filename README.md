REopt Lite API
=========
The REopt™ Lite model in this repository is a free, open-source, development version of the [REopt™ Lite API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt-v1/). A production version of the REopt™ Lite API lies behind the [REopt™ Lite Webtool](https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool).

REopt Lite offers a subset of features from NREL's more comprehensive [REopt model](https://reopt.nrel.gov/about/).
Both models provide concurrent, multiple technology integration and optimization capabilities to help organizations meet their cost savings and energy performance goals. Formulated as a mixed integer linear program, the REopt models recommend an optimally sized mix of renewable energy, conventional generation, and energy storage technologies; estimates the net present value of implementing those technologies; and provides a dispatch strategy for operating the technology mix at maximum economic efficiency. A comparison of the REopt and REopt Lite is provided [here](https://reopt.nrel.gov/analysis/capabilities-comparison.html).
