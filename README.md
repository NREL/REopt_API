REopt API
=========
The REopt™ model in this repository is a free, open-source, development version of the [REopt™ API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt-v1/). A production version of the REopt™ API lies behind the [REopt™ Webtool](https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool).

REopt offers a subset of features from NREL's more comprehensive [REopt model](https://reopt.nrel.gov/about/).
Both models provide concurrent, multiple technology integration and optimization capabilities to help organizations meet their cost savings and energy performance goals. Formulated as a mixed integer linear program, the REopt models recommend an optimally sized mix of renewable energy, conventional generation, and energy storage technologies; estimates the net present value of implementing those technologies; and provides a dispatch strategy for operating the technology mix at maximum economic efficiency. A comparison of the REopt and REopt models is provided [here](https://reopt.nrel.gov/analysis/capabilities-comparison.html).

## Using the REopt API
If you just want to use the REopt API (and not modify the code or host the API on your own server) then you can access our production version of the API via the [NREL Developer Network](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/energy-optimization/reopt-v1/). 

If you would like to do more than use the API, see our [Wiki](https://github.com/NREL/reopt_api/wiki) for detailed instructions on installing the API. Also, our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NREL/reopt_api/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) provide guidelines for suggesting improvements, creating pull requests, and more.
