    saved to the DB, and calculating the outage costs is done before the results are saved because it is one of the
    results.

    NOTE: this function saves the outage simulator results to the database to ensure that the simulation is not run
    twice (second time occurs when user calls resilience_stats endpoint with run_uuid).
