    ### Major Updates
    ### Minor Updates
    ##### Added
    ##### Changed
    ##### Fixed
    ##### Deprecated
    ##### Removed
    ### Patches

## v1.6.0 - 2021-06-09
### Minor Updates
##### Added
- `summary`: Added `/summary_by_chunk` endpoint to enable a fraction of a user's total runs and summary metrics to be returned; this prevents excessive wait times when the UI was trying to load all runs
- New `<host>/dev/futurecosts` endpoint 
##### Patches
- was returning -1 for `bau_sustained_time_steps` when no critical load was met in BAU case (now returns zero)
- fixed issue with modeling last time step of the year in outages 
- `NewMaxSize` was sometimes less than the `TechClassMinSize`, creating infeasible problems
- fix `user` URLs

## v1.5.0 - 2021-03-12
### Minor Updates
##### Changed
- `reo`, `*.jl`: Changed the units-basis for heating load, thermal production, and fuel consumption to kW/kWh, from mmbtu/mmbtu_per_hr and gal. This does not affect the units of the inputs or outputs.
##### Removed
- `reo`: The following inputs for `Site.Boiler`: `installed_cost_us_dollars_per_mmbtu_per_hr`, `min_mmbtu_per_hr`, and `max_mmbtu_per_hr`, and for `Site.ElectricChiller`: `installed_cost_us_dollars_per_kw`, `min_kw`, and `max_kw`.
### Patches
- `reo`: Catch issue in `process_results.py` where `renewable_electricity_energy_pct` is not explicitly set to _None_
- `reo`:  Catch case where `CHP` `prime_mover` is not set and not all required fields are filled in
- `reo`:  Catch issues with `itc_unit_basis` when the ITC is 100%
- `validators.py`: Fix bug where length of percent_share != length of doe_reference_name even though no percent_share is provided (in `LoadProfileBoilerFuel`)

## v1.4.4 - 2021-02-25
### Patches
- `reo`: In `validators.py` catches case where invalid percent_share entry was used in check special cases function

## v1.4.0 - 2021-01-29
### Major Updates
### Minor Updates
## Added
- `reo`/`reopt.jl`: Coincident peak rates and expected time steps can be specified. There can be a single rate and list of time steps. Or there can be multiple CP periods in a year with different rates, and then a set of time steps is specified for each rate. Peak demand occurring during each set of CP time steps is charged at the corresponding CP rate.

- `reo`: Add a new **ElectricTariff** inputs and outputs:
 - **coincident_peak_load_active_timesteps**
 - **coincident_peak_load_charge_us_dollars_per_kw**
 - **year_one_coincident_peak_cost_us_dollars**
 - **year_one_coincident_peak_cost_bau_us_dollars**
 - **total_coincident_peak_cost_us_dollars**
 - **total_coincident_peak_cost_bau_us_dollars**

## v1.3.0 - 2021-01-28
### Major Updates
### Minor Updates

- `reo`, `*.jl`: New load **LoadProfileBoilerFuel**
    - Heating load of the site, as defined by boiler fuel consumption
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Tech **Boiler**
    - BAU Tech which serves heating load. It consumes fuel and produces hot thermal energy.
- `reo`: New **Site**-level input **FuelTariff**
    - Cost structure for fuel consumed by **Boiler** and **CHP** Techs. Currently allows fixed annual or monthly values for fuel cost.
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New load **LoadProfileChillerThermal**
    - Cooling load of the site, as defined by a thermal load produced by the BAU **ElectricChiller** or a fraction of total electric load.
    - This is treated as a subset of the total electric load (**LoadProfile**)
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Tech **ElectricChiller**
    - BAU Tech which serves cooling load. It consumes electricity and produces chilled water to meet the cooling load or charge **ColdTES**.
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Tech **CHP**
    - Combined heat and power (CHP) Tech which serves electric and heating loads. Its hot thermal production can also supply **AbsorptionChiller** or charge the **HotTES**.
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Tech **AbsorptionChiller**
    - Cooling technology which serves cooling load with a hot thermal input. It can also charge **ColdTES**.
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Storage **HotTES**
    - Storage model representing a hot water thermal energy storage tank. It can store hot thermal energy produced by **CHP** (or **Boiler**, but not typically).
- `reo`, `*.jl`: New Storage **ColdTES**
    - Storage model representing a chilled water thermal energy storage tank. It can store cold thermal energy produced by **ElectricChiller** or **AbsorptionChiller**.
- `reo`: Changed `/simulated_load` endpoint to add optional **load_type** query param for **cooling** and **heating**
    - Use **load_type** = "heating" with **annual_mmbtu** or **monthly_mmbtu** for heating load
    - Use **load_type** = "cooling" with **annual_tonhour** or **monthly_tonhour** for cooling load
- `reo`: New endpoint `/chp_defaults`
    - Endpoint for the default **prime_mover**, **size_class**, and default cost and performance parameters for **CHP**
- `reo`: New endpoint `/loadprofile_chillerthermal_chiller_cop`
    - Endpoint for the default **LoadProfileChillerThermal.chiller_cop** based on peak cooling load

- `reo`: New endpoint `/schedule_stats`
    - Endpoint for getting default **CHP.chp_unavailability_periods** and summary metrics of the unavailability profile
### Patches
 - `summary`: Address failing cases in user `summary` endpoint due to missing load profile data


## v1.2.0 - 2021-01-04
### Major Updates
### Minor Updates
##### Added
- `reo`: new inputs **outage_start_time_step** and **outage_end_time_step** to replace deprecated **outage_start_hour** and **outage_end_hour**. The latter are used as time step indices in the code, so for sub-hourly problems they do not have hourly units. For now **outage_start_hour** and **outage_end_hour** are kept in place to preserve backwards-compatibility. Also note that the new inputs are not zero-indexed.
- `reo`: new output **bau_sustained_time_steps** to replace deprecated **sustain_hours** (also not deprecated yet but warning is now in response).
- `*.jl`: new **dvProductionToCurtail** for all techs in all time steps (was previously construed with dvProductionToGrid for the third sales tier, which is meant for selling energy back to the grid beyond the annual load kWh constraint.)
- `reo`:  new inputs for all Techs: **can_net_meter**, **can_wholesale**, **can_export_beyond_site_load**, **can_curtail**
    - the first three correspond to the previous `SalesTiers`, now called `ExportTiers`
    - reduces the problem size in many cases since the previous model always included all three `SalesTiers` in every scenario and the new model only includes `ExportTiers` with non-zero compensation when there are Technologies that can participate

##### Changed
- `resilience_stats`: Calculate **avoided_outage_costs_us_dollars** from the `outagesimjob` endpoint
##### Fixed
##### Deprecated
- `reo`: **LoadProfile** **outage_start_hour** and **outage_end_hour** in favor of **outage_start_time_step** and **outage_end_time_step**
- `reo`: **LoadProfile** **sustain_hours** in favor of **bau_sustained_time_steps**

##### Removed

### Patches
- `resilience_stats`: Catch BAU cases and do not calculate avoided outage costs
- `summary`: Catch jobs that errored out and do not parse results
- `reo`: Catch `PVWattsDownloadError` when a bad response is received
- `reo`: **fuel_used_gal** output for **Generator** was incorrect for scenarios with **time_steps_per_hour** not equal to 1

## v1.0.0 - 2020-02-28
### Major
- First release of the REopt API
- Setting version number to 0.1.0 (and not 1.0.0) to reflect the fact that this version of the REopt API has not been used in a production environment
  - The primary difference between the production version of the REopt API and the open-source version is that the production version uses a Mosel model (FICO Xpress modeling language) and the open-source version using a Julia JuMP model (to allow compatibility with more solvers)
